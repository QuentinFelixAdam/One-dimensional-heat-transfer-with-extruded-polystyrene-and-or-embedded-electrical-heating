Provided here is a Fortran90 code to calculate the maximal frost front penetration within a domain representing an asphalt concrete pavement insulated with extretuded polystyrene combined to electrical heating.

The Fortran90 code takes as input the files:  - "Indices_de_gel.dat" --> it contains a list of freezing indexes covering the entire province of QuÃ©bec, Canada.
                                    - "para.dat" --> it contains relevant parameters required to perform calculations
                                    - "Temp_amp.dat" --> it contains the temperature amplitudes utilized to construct the top boundary condition
                                    - "Temp_moyenne.dat" --> it contains the temperature averahes utilized to construct the top boundary condition
                                    
The Fortran90 code produces as output Tdepth.XX.dat files, which can be treated with the Python code "Treat files.py". This code takes as input all TdepthXX.dat files and generates a "Summary.dat" file. "Summary.dat" contains the maximal frost front penetration depth.

To launch the Fortran90 code, place all the input files and "temp_abaques.f90" within the same folder. Open a terminal, navigate to the folder, and type "gfortran -o exe temp_updated_structure.f90", wait for the compilation (less than a second) and then type "exe".

To run the Python code, make sure you change appropriately the path folder.

You can modify some parameters such as the layers thicknesses, total volumetric water contents, etc. The values which can be modified are within the file "temp_updated_structure.f90" between line 237 and 273. 

This code is linked to a manuscript which will be published. Once published, I will share the citation information if you decide to utilize the code.
